# chatscroll

Ultimate goal of this project is to make chatGPT app scrollable with keyboard.

It is implemented as a JS to be used with TamperMonkey. 
It is supposed to be published to GreasyFork and be taken from there. 

Essentially this script adds tabindex = 1 to the div containing all the answers which makes it scrollable with keyboard.
